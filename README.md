# 🧪 The QA Git Practice Lab

Welcome to the **QA Git Practice Lab**! This repository is designed specifically for Software Quality Assurance (QA) and Test Automation Engineers who want to master core Git and GitHub concepts through practical, hands-on exercises.

**Why is Git important for QA?** In modern software development, test automation code is treated just like application code. Mastering Git is essential for managing your test scripts, collaborating with developers, and contributing effectively within CI/CD pipelines.
